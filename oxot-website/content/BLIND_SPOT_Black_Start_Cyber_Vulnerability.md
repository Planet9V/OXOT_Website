## The Blind Spot

Electric utilities spend billions on preventing outages. Grid operators drill constantly on N-1 contingency scenarios. NERC CIP standards mandate cybersecurity controls for bulk electric systems. Yet across the industry, a critical blind spot persists: **we plan for physical disasters, not cyber-orchestrated catastrophes targeting our ability to recover.**

The conventional assumption is that black start capability—the ability to restart the grid after a complete blackout without external power—will be available when needed. Utilities identify black start-capable units, test them periodically (often annually), and check the regulatory compliance box. But this planning paradigm was designed for physical events: hurricanes, ice storms, equipment failures, even geomagnetic disturbances. It assumes that when the grid collapses, the black start assets themselves remain functional and can execute their restoration sequence.

That assumption is obsolete.

Today's threat actors—whether sophisticated criminal ransomware syndicates or nation-state adversaries—understand grid operations intimately. They know which generating units possess black start capability. They study SCADA architectures, distributed control systems (DCS), turbine control networks, and energy management systems (EMS). More critically, they understand that the highest-value target is not causing the initial blackout—it's preventing restoration. A grid that goes dark for hours is a crisis. A grid that cannot be restarted for days or weeks is a national security catastrophe.

The renewable energy transition compounds this vulnerability. Traditional black start resources—large fossil fuel plants with inherent rotating mass and the ability to energize transmission networks from a cold start—are retiring at an accelerating pace. Wind and solar facilities, which dominate new capacity additions, lack intrinsic black start capability; they are inverter-based resources that require an established grid voltage reference to synchronize. As the generation fleet transforms, utilities are losing the physical infrastructure required for grid restoration, often without a replacement strategy.

This convergence creates the blind spot: **we are simultaneously eliminating our black start capacity through the energy transition while failing to protect the remaining capability from cyber threats specifically designed to target restoration processes.**

## What Black Start Actually Means

Black start is the foundational capability for grid recovery following a total or near-total collapse of the electrical system. Unlike normal grid operations where generators synchronize to an established network frequency and voltage, a black start unit must energize the grid from zero—literally creating the initial voltage reference that allows other generators to come online.

### The Restoration Sequence

The black start restoration process follows a carefully choreographed sequence:

1. **Self-Start:** The black start unit powers itself up without drawing from the electrical grid, typically using on-site diesel generators, batteries, or stored hydraulic energy.

2. **Energize Local Station:** The unit brings its own station auxiliaries online—the pumps, fans, controls, and protection systems required to operate the generator.

3. **Build Transmission Path:** The black start unit gradually energizes transmission lines radiating from its location, carefully managing reactive power to prevent voltage collapse across long, unloaded lines.

4. **Crank Adjacent Units:** Once transmission paths are established, the black start unit provides power to "crank" (restart) adjacent non-black-start generators, bringing them from cold iron to synchronized operation.

5. **Restore System:** As more generation comes online, operators progressively restore load, balance generation and demand, and rebuild the interconnected system frequency and voltage stability.

### Critical Technical Requirements

Black start capability demands specific technical characteristics:

- **Large synchronous generators:** Traditional rotating machines (steam turbines, combustion turbines, hydro units) with massive flywheels that provide system inertia and voltage control.

- **Islanding capability:** The unit must operate independently, establishing its own voltage and frequency reference without relying on a broader grid signal.

- **Reactive power control:** Critical for energizing long transmission lines without the voltage support normally provided by interconnected generators and compensating equipment.

- **Skilled operators:** Black start is not an automated procedure. It requires operators intimately familiar with the system topology, protection schemes, and the nuanced control adjustments needed during restoration under degraded conditions.

### Historical Timelines

Under ideal conditions with intact infrastructure and functional control systems, grid operators target restoration of 60% of demand within 24 hours following a black start initiation. Full system restoration historically ranges from 12 to 72 hours, depending on the scale of the outage, geographical extent, infrastructure damage, and seasonal conditions (winter restoration with low renewable output being particularly challenging). However, these timelines assume that control systems, communications networks, and the black start units themselves are operational and trustworthy.

## The Renewable Transition Problem

The accelerating transformation of the generation fleet fundamentally undermines black start capability in ways utility planners are only beginning to acknowledge.

### Why Inverter-Based Resources Can't Black Start (Traditionally)

Wind turbines and solar photovoltaic systems connect to the grid through power electronic inverters. These devices convert the variable DC output of solar panels or the variable-frequency AC from wind generators into grid-synchronous AC power. However, conventional grid-following inverters are fundamentally dependent on an existing grid voltage and frequency reference. They synchronize to the grid's waveform; they do not create it.

This creates a critical dependency: inverter-based resources (IBRs) cannot energize a de-energized transmission system. They require the grid to already exist before they can contribute. From a black start perspective, a 100 MW solar farm has the same capability as a passive load—it cannot initiate the restoration sequence.

### Battery Storage: Partial Solution, Significant Limitations

Grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) offer potential black start support, and several pilot projects have demonstrated technical feasibility. Batteries can provide the initial energy injection to energize local networks and crank thermal generators. However, significant limitations remain:

- **Duration constraints:** Even large-scale BESS installations provide only 2-4 hours of energy at rated output. Black start restoration is a multi-hour to multi-day process requiring sustained energy delivery.

- **Reactive power capability:** While advanced grid-forming inverters (discussed below) can provide reactive support, this remains an emerging technology not widely deployed.

- **State of charge uncertainty:** If the grid collapses unexpectedly, battery systems may be partially discharged, reducing their available restoration capacity.

### The Retirement Wave

The urgency of this problem is defined by the pace of fossil plant retirements. Between 2010 and 2024, the U.S. retired over 100 GW of coal capacity—much of it possessing black start capability. An additional 50+ GW of coal retirements are planned by 2030. Natural gas combined-cycle plants are increasingly providing black start services, but many utilities have not formalized procurement mechanisms or testing requirements for these newer resources.

Crucially, utilities often discover their black start gaps only when a traditional black start unit announces retirement. By that point, replacement options are limited, and developing alternative black start resources (such as deploying grid-forming battery systems or retrofitting existing generation) requires years of engineering, permitting, and capital investment.

### The Grid-Forming Inverter Promise (and Challenge)

Emerging grid-forming (GFM) inverter technology offers a potential pathway. Unlike grid-following inverters, GFM systems actively establish voltage and frequency, mimicking the behavior of synchronous generators. Advanced GFM battery systems have successfully demonstrated black start capability in pilot deployments.

However, widespread GFM adoption faces substantial barriers: lack of standardized interconnection requirements, limited operational experience, higher costs compared to conventional grid-following inverters, and complex control interactions when multiple GFM and grid-following resources coexist. Industry estimates suggest GFM deployment will be gradual, with meaningful penetration unlikely before 2030-2035—precisely when the black start capability gap will be most acute.

## The Cyber Attack Scenario: A Coordinated Restoration Denial

The nightmare scenario is not the initial blackout. It is the calculated, multi-vector cyber attack designed to prevent restoration.

### Attack Surface: Every Control Layer Simultaneously

Modern black start assets depend on deeply interconnected digital infrastructure:

- **Energy Management Systems (EMS):** Centralized SCADA platforms providing operators visibility into system topology, generation status, and transmission flows. Compromise here creates "loss of view"—operators cannot see the grid state and cannot coordinate restoration.

- **Distributed Control Systems (DCS):** Plant-level control networks managing boiler controls, turbine governors, fuel systems, and generator excitation. Ransomware encryption of DCS human-machine interfaces (HMIs) or engineering workstations renders operators unable to start, control, or safely operate generating units.

- **Turbine Control Systems:** Embedded controllers managing turbine speed, temperature, and vibration. Manipulation of these systems during black start attempts could cause catastrophic mechanical damage—overspeed trips, loss of lubrication, thermal stress fractures.

- **Protection Relays:** Digital protective relays safeguard equipment by detecting abnormal conditions (overcurrent, undervoltage, frequency excursions) and triggering circuit breaker trips. False data injection into relay logic could cause spurious trips during restoration, repeatedly interrupting energization attempts. Alternatively, disabled protection could allow equipment damage to propagate undetected.

- **Communications Networks:** Black start restoration requires continuous coordination between control centers, generating plants, and field switching locations. Disruption of operational communications—whether through denial-of-service attacks on utility communication networks or GPS spoofing disrupting time-synchronized protection schemes—fragments the coordinated restoration process.

### The Ransomware-Plus-Physical-Damage Hybrid

Advanced threat actors understand that encryption alone may be recoverable through backups and manual operations. The truly devastating scenario combines ransomware with commands that cause physical equipment damage:

- **Turbine overspeed:** Commands sent to turbine governors to disable speed control or open fuel valves beyond safe limits, causing mechanical destruction of turbine blades and bearings.

- **Transformer overexcitation:** Manipulation of generator excitation systems or tap changer controls to drive transformers into saturation, causing catastrophic overheating and failure.

- **Synchronization errors:** False data causing generators to close onto the grid out of phase, creating massive mechanical and electrical shock loads that can shear generator shafts or destroy switchgear.

These physical damage scenarios extend restoration timelines from hours to weeks or months, as destroyed equipment must be replaced—often with lead times measured in quarters for large power transformers.

### Timeline: Weeks, Not Hours

In this coordinated scenario, restoration no longer follows the 12-72 hour historical timeline. Consider the realistic sequence:

- **Hours 0-24:** Operators recognize the outage, attempt black start procedures, and discover that control systems are compromised. Encrypted HMIs, communications failures, and protection system malfunctions prevent standard restoration sequences.

- **Days 1-3:** Incident response teams begin forensic analysis to determine the scope of compromise. IT and OT systems are isolated. Utilities attempt manual control from local plant control rooms, but many modern facilities lack fully independent manual control capabilities.

- **Days 3-7:** Utilities begin deploying backup control systems, restoring from clean media, and validating that plant control systems are free of persistent malware. This requires bringing in specialized OT cybersecurity forensic teams and potentially equipment vendors for control system integrity verification.

- **Week 2+:** Assuming no physical equipment damage, utilities begin cautious black start attempts using validated control systems. However, each attempt is slow and methodical, as operators lack confidence in protection systems and must proceed with extreme caution to prevent equipment damage.

- **Weeks to Months:** If physical equipment damage occurred (transformers destroyed, turbines damaged), restoration timelines extend to equipment replacement schedules. Large power transformers have 12-18 month lead times.

### Cascading Failures Across Interconnections

The U.S. grid comprises three largely independent synchronous interconnections: Eastern, Western, and ERCOT (Texas). However, a coordinated black start denial attack could cascade across these boundaries through economic and societal disruption:

- **Fuel supply chain collapse:** Extended blackouts disrupt fuel production, refining, and transportation. Even unaffected regions face fuel shortages, limiting generation capability.

- **Communication infrastructure degradation:** Cellular and internet infrastructure depends on backup generation with finite fuel supplies. After 48-72 hours without grid power, communication networks in affected regions fail, hampering restoration coordination.

- **Public order and emergency services:** Multi-day blackouts strain emergency services, overwhelm backup power for hospitals and critical facilities, and create civil unrest that diverts utility personnel from restoration efforts to security and family safety concerns.

## Current Regulatory Gaps

NERC CIP standards—the mandatory cybersecurity requirements for bulk electric systems—focus overwhelmingly on prevention. They mandate perimeter security, access controls, patch management, and incident response planning. However, significant gaps exist in the restoration context:

### CIP Focuses on Prevention, Not Recovery

NERC CIP-003 through CIP-011 establish cybersecurity controls for critical cyber assets. These standards assume that if prevention fails and a compromise occurs, utilities will recover through incident response and business continuity processes. However, CIP standards do not explicitly require:

- **Cyber-isolated black start controls:** There is no mandate that black start units maintain air-gapped or segmented control systems immune to enterprise network compromises.

- **Restoration scenario testing:** Black start testing (per NERC EOP-005) verifies that units can start and energize transmission lines. Testing does not include scenarios where SCADA, EMS, or plant DCS are compromised or unavailable.

- **Manual operation capability:** Modern digital control systems often lack fully manual backup control modes. CIP does not require utilities to maintain manual black start capability independent of networked control systems.

### Black Start Testing: Physical, Not Cyber

NERC EOP-005 and regional reliability standards require periodic black start testing, typically annually or every 2-3 years depending on the region. However, these tests validate physical and electrical capability—can the unit self-start, can it energize transmission, can it support cranking paths for adjacent generators.

Testing does not include:

- **Compromised SCADA scenarios:** Executing black start procedures when operators have no visibility into remote breaker status, line flows, or system frequency.

- **DCS unavailability:** Operating generating units using local control panels when plant-wide control systems are encrypted or untrusted.

- **Communication network failure:** Coordinating multi-site restoration without normal voice, data, or SCADA communication channels.

### No Requirement for Cyber-Hardened Black Start Capability

Utilities are not required to designate and harden a subset of black start resources with enhanced cyber resilience. Unlike defense-in-depth strategies for critical military or financial systems (where high-consequence functions receive extraordinary protection), grid black start capability receives the same baseline CIP controls as other bulk electric system assets.

This creates a perverse outcome: the capability required to restore the grid after catastrophic failure receives no special protection commensurate with its criticality.

## Closing the Blind Spot

Addressing this vulnerability requires a fundamental shift in how utilities and regulators conceptualize black start capability—from a physical reliability resource to a cyber-resilient national security asset.

### Cyber-Hardened Black Start Assets

Utilities must identify a designated set of black start resources and subject them to extraordinary cyber hardening:

- **Air-gapped control systems:** Critical black start plant controls (DCS, turbine governors, excitation systems) should operate on physically isolated networks with no pathway to enterprise IT or even operational SCADA networks.

- **Manual control capability:** Black start units must retain fully functional manual local control, allowing plant operators to start, synchronize, and load the unit without any digital control system or external communication.

- **Electromagnetic shielding:** Protection against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) threats—whether from solar storms or adversarial weapons—through shielded control rooms and hardened electronics.

### Cyber-Informed Black Start Testing

Black start testing protocols must evolve to include cyber compromise scenarios:

- **Zero-visibility exercises:** Conduct black start drills where control center operators have no SCADA visibility and must rely entirely on voice communication with field personnel and local plant operators.

- **Compromised DCS scenarios:** Test black start execution using only local plant control panels, assuming that networked HMIs and engineering workstation access are unavailable.

- **Blue-team/red-team exercises:** Pair black start drills with simulated cyber attacks, where red teams attempt to disrupt restoration while blue teams execute procedures under adversarial conditions.

### Redundant and Diverse Black Start Resources

Utilities must move beyond single-point dependencies:

- **Geographic diversity:** Ensure black start capability exists in multiple locations within each balancing authority area, so that localized cyber or physical attacks cannot eliminate all restoration pathways.

- **Technology diversity:** Develop black start capability across multiple technology types—traditional thermal generation, hydro, grid-forming battery storage—so that a technology-specific vulnerability (e.g., a common DCS platform exploited across all units) does not compromise all black start resources simultaneously.

### Grid-Forming Battery Storage as Strategic Reserve

Accelerate deployment of grid-forming battery storage specifically for black start applications:

- **Cyber-isolated BESS:** Deploy dedicated battery installations with air-gapped controls, physically separate from grid-connected renewable or market-participating storage assets.

- **Pre-positioned equipment:** Maintain strategic reserves of mobile grid-forming battery systems and micro-turbine generators that can be rapidly deployed to critical substations to establish energization points during prolonged restoration events.

### Cross-Train Operators on Manual Procedures

The human element is the ultimate fallback:

- **Manual restoration training:** Regularly train control room and plant operators on manual black start procedures, including communication protocols, manual breaker operation, and voltage control without automated systems.

- **Tabletop exercises:** Conduct quarterly tabletop exercises walking through restoration scenarios with degraded or unavailable digital systems, ensuring operators understand decision trees, coordination requirements, and manual equipment operation.

- **Institutional knowledge preservation:** Document and preserve detailed restoration procedures, system one-line diagrams, and equipment operation manuals in hardcopy formats accessible without digital systems.

## Urgency: The Window is Narrowing

This is not a theoretical future risk. It is an immediate national security vulnerability:

- **Known adversary capability:** Nation-state threat actors (Russian Sandworm/Voodoo Bear, Chinese Volt Typhoon, Iranian groups) have demonstrated both intent and capability to target grid infrastructure. Public reporting confirms pre-positioning of malware in critical infrastructure for potential future activation.

- **Accelerating retirements:** Every month, additional fossil plants with black start capability retire. Utilities are losing restoration capacity faster than replacement capabilities are being developed.

- **Increasing attack sophistication:** Ransomware groups are partnering with initial access brokers who specialize in OT environments. The barrier to entry for grid-targeting attacks is lowering.

The convergence of these trends means the vulnerability window is narrowing. Utilities that act now—investing in cyber-hardened black start resources, conducting realistic restoration exercises, and deploying grid-forming alternatives—will be prepared. Those that delay will face a crisis of restoration capability precisely when it is most needed.

## Call to Action

### For Utility Executives and Boards:

**Request a black start cyber resilience assessment.** Commission an independent evaluation of your black start resources through a cyber threat lens. Do not accept assurances that "we comply with NERC CIP." Ask: *If our SCADA and plant DCS were encrypted by ransomware today, could we execute black start? How long would it take? What is our manual restoration capability?*

### For Regulators (FERC, NERC, State PUCs):

**Update reliability standards to include restoration resilience.** Develop new requirements mandating cyber-hardened black start capability, testing protocols that include cyber compromise scenarios, and procurement mechanisms ensuring replacement black start resources as traditional units retire.

### For Grid Operators:

**Conduct tabletop exercises with a cyber component.** Schedule a multi-day exercise simulating a coordinated cyber attack on black start resources. Involve IT, OT, engineering, and executive leadership. Identify gaps in communication, authority, manual procedures, and backup systems. Remediate before the real event occurs.

## Black Start Cyber Readiness Checklist

Utility leaders should use this checklist to evaluate and enhance black start cyber resilience:

### Inventory and Dependency Analysis
- ✓ **Comprehensive black start asset inventory:** Document all black start-capable generating units, including their MW capacity, fuel type, technology, and last successful test date.
- ✓ **Cyber dependency mapping:** For each black start unit, map all digital control system dependencies (DCS, turbine controls, SCADA, communications, protection relays). Identify common points of failure.
- ✓ **Communication pathway analysis:** Document all communication channels required for black start coordination (SCADA links, microwave, fiber, cellular, radio). Identify backup paths.

### Cyber Hardening
- ✓ **Air-gap critical black start controls:** Isolate black start unit control systems from enterprise networks and operational SCADA where feasible. Implement unidirectional gateways for data export where isolation is complete.
- ✓ **Manual control capability verification:** Verify and test that black start units can be started, synchronized, and loaded using only local manual controls without any digital system or external communication.
- ✓ **Protection relay integrity:** Ensure protective relay settings for black start units and associated transmission paths are stored in hardcopy and backed up offline. Validate relay firmware integrity.

### Testing and Exercises
- ✓ **Black start testing with compromised SCADA assumption:** Conduct annual black start tests where control center operators have no SCADA visibility and must execute restoration using voice communication and local manual operations only.
- ✓ **Tabletop restoration exercises:** Quarterly tabletop exercises simulating cyber compromise of EMS, DCS, or communications during a restoration event. Include IT, OT, and executive decision-makers.
- ✓ **Red team / blue team drills:** Annual exercises where red teams simulate cyber attacks against black start systems while blue teams execute restoration procedures under adversarial conditions.

### Redundancy and Alternatives
- ✓ **Geographic and technology diversity:** Ensure black start capability exists across multiple physical locations and technology types within each balancing area. Avoid single points of failure.
- ✓ **Grid-forming battery pilot deployment:** Evaluate and pilot grid-forming battery energy storage systems for black start applications, particularly in areas losing traditional fossil black start resources.
- ✓ **Pre-positioned restoration equipment:** Maintain strategic reserves of mobile generation (gas turbines, diesel generators) and grid-forming battery systems that can be rapidly deployed to critical substations.

### Knowledge and Training
- ✓ **Operator manual restoration training:** Ensure all control room and plant operators receive annual training on manual black start procedures, including manual breaker operation, manual voltage control, and communication protocols during degraded conditions.
- ✓ **Hardcopy procedure documentation:** Maintain comprehensive hardcopy restoration procedure manuals, system one-line diagrams, equipment operating instructions, and contact lists accessible without digital systems or network access.

**The grid's ability to restart after catastrophic failure is not a technical curiosity—it is a national security imperative. The convergence of cyber threats targeting restoration capabilities and the physical elimination of black start resources through the energy transition creates an invisible but profound vulnerability. Closing this blind spot requires immediate action, regulatory evolution, and a fundamental reconceptualization of black start capability as a cyber-resilient strategic asset worthy of extraordinary protection.**
