**Location:** Lines 155-173

**BEFORE (213 words, 9 sentences in 2 massive paragraphs):**
```
OXOT's Cyber Assurance, Testing & Validation services provide critical infrastructure operators
with comprehensive security assessments that go far beyond traditional IT security testing.
Our approach recognizes the unique constraints and requirements of operational technology
environments, where system availability, safety integrity, and operational continuity are paramount.
We employ a risk-based methodology aligned with IEC 62443 standards, ensuring that
our testing activities enhance security without compromising operational reliability.

Our team brings deep expertise in SCADA systems, distributed control systems (DCS), programmable
logic controllers (PLCs), safety instrumented systems (SIS), and the industrial protocols (Modbus,
DNP3, IEC 61850, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET) that connect them. This operational knowledge, combined
with advanced penetration testing techniques and adversarial emulation capabilities, allows us to
identify vulnerabilities that traditional IT security assessments routinely miss. We understand
the difference between a vulnerability in a corporate network and one in a system controlling a
power plant turbine, water treatment facility, or manufacturing production line—and we tailor our
testing methodology, tools, and reporting accordingly.

<h4>Executive Summary</h4>
OXOT provides comprehensive security assessments for critical infrastructure operators. Our approach
goes beyond traditional IT security testing. We recognize the unique constraints of operational
technology environments. System availability, safety integrity, and operational continuity are paramount.

We employ a risk-based methodology aligned with IEC 62443 standards. Our testing enhances security
without compromising operational reliability. All assessments are designed specifically for
environments where downtime isn't an option.

<h4>Why Traditional IT Testing Falls Short in OT</h4>
Our team brings deep expertise in industrial control systems. We understand SCADA systems,
distributed control systems (DCS), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and safety instrumented
systems (SIS). We're experts in industrial protocols including Modbus, DNP3, IEC 61850, EtherNet/IP,
and PROFINET.

This operational knowledge combines with advanced penetration testing techniques. We identify
vulnerabilities that traditional IT assessments routinely miss. We understand the critical difference
between a corporate network vulnerability and one in a system controlling power generation, water
treatment, or manufacturing.

We tailor our testing methodology, tools, and reporting to your operational reality.

```
When a cybersecurity incident impacts critical infrastructure, every second counts. OXOT's Crisis
Management and Incident Response services provide rapid, expert support specifically designed for
operational technology environments where traditional IT incident response approaches can be
insufficient or even dangerous. Our team combines deep OT/ICS technical expertise with crisis
management experience, legal compliance knowledge, and operational safety understanding—ensuring
that response activities prioritize operational continuity and public safety while effectively
containing and remediating security threats.

We understand that a cybersecurity incident in critical infrastructure is fundamentally different from
a corporate IT breach. The potential consequences—from cascading failures in power grids to safety
system malfunctions in manufacturing plants—require a response approach that balances cybersecurity
objectives with operational imperatives. Our incident response methodology, developed through real-world
engagements across Energy, Manufacturing, Water, and Transportation sectors, ensures that we can
effectively support organizations through their most challenging moments while protecting attorney-client
privilege and minimizing disclosure obligations.
