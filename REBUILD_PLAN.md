# OXOT Website Comprehensive Rebuild Plan
**Date:** November 16, 2025
**Branch:** claude/rebuild-cybersecurity-site-014agQ2GtfmyZHTwXewxUWrG
**Objective:** Transform OXOT website into world-class cybersecurity platform for C-suite executives

---

## Executive Summary

This rebuild transforms the OXOT website from surface-level content to a comprehensive, professional cybersecurity platform that positions OXOT as the premier OT/ICS security authority. The rebuild leverages:

- **89 content files** (29,888 lines) of professional material
- **Jim McKenney's AEON Cyber Digital Twin** thought leadership
- **NexBank menu system architecture** (well-built, will be retained)
- **Deep technical content** suitable for CIOs and executives
- **Multiple frameworks**: IEC 62443, Ransomware Resilience, M&A Due Diligence

**Critical Requirements:**
1. ✅ Preserve `/r3f-background-test` route (brand/style generator)
2. Replace ALL NexBank banking content with OXOT cybersecurity
3. Feature AEON Digital Twin prominently with multiple pages
4. Create long-form, compelling service landing pages
5. Integrate threat intelligence and thought leadership
6. Professional, academic-style writing with APA citations where appropriate

---

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- **Exceptional Content Arsenal**: 89 files including Jim McKenney's grid stability analysis, IEC 62443 standards, threat intelligence, IACS inventories
- **Solid Technical Foundation**: React 19.2.0, Vite 7.2.2, GSAP animations, Three.js backgrounds
- **Well-Built Menu System**: NexBank architecture is professional and functional
- **Dark Theme Ready**: pwnk.digital-inspired aesthetic (#0D0D0D, #00FFD1)

### ⚠️ Critical Issues Fixed
1. ✅ **FIXED**: `/r3f-background-test` route added to App.jsx
2. ✅ **FIXED**: `prop-types` dependency installed
3. **TODO**: menuData.js still contains NexBank banking services (needs OXOT cybersecurity)
4. **TODO**: Current content is superficial - not leveraging professional material
5. **TODO**: AEON Digital Twin branding missing
6. **TODO**: No Articles, Resources, or Thought Leadership sections
7. **TODO**: 89 content files not integrated into UI

## Key Content Examples

### Executive-Level Writing (from Jim McKenney)
> *"We are witnessing a decline in the system's inherent physical stability, a consequence of replacing traditional power plants with new, inverter-based technologies. This isn't merely an engineering footnote; it's a critical management challenge with profound implications for national security, economic continuity, and public safety."*

### Technical Depth (from Resilient Factory)
> *"For the manufacturing sector, ransomware is no longer just a threat to data; it is a direct assault on production. The modern cybercriminal's goal is to halt assembly lines, disrupt supply chains, and create maximum operational chaos to force a ransom payment."*

### Financial Impact (from M&A Framework)
> *"The critical distinction between IT and OT is paramount...A failure to rigorously assess and integrate cybersecurity considerations represents a material threat to investment returns and operational stability."*
