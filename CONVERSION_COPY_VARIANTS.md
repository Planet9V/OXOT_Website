---

### Statistical Significance Calculator

```
Required Sample Size = (Z^2 × p × (1-p)) / (margin_of_error^2)

Where:
- Z = 1.96 (for 95% confidence)
- p = expected conversion rate (0.15 for 15%)
- margin_of_error = 0.03 (for ±3% accuracy)

Example:
Required Sample = (1.96^2 × 0.15 × 0.85) / 0.03^2
                = 544.2 per variant

Recommendation: 600+ conversions per variant for 95% confidence
```

---

### Success Criteria

**Headline Test Success:**
- Primary: Conversion rate increase >15%
- Secondary: Lead quality score increase >5%
- Guard rail: Form completion rate decrease <10% (ensure headline doesn't attract wrong audience)

**CTA Test Success:**
- Primary: Conversion rate increase >10%
- Secondary: Click-through rate from form start to submission >70%
- Guard rail: No increase in invalid submissions (bots, fake emails)

**Overall Campaign Success (90 Days):**

- MQL rate: 70%+ (vs 60% baseline)
- Lead-to-opportunity rate: 10%+ (vs 8% baseline)
- Cost per MQL: <$50 (organic traffic, no paid acquisition)
